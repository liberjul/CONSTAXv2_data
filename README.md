# CONSTAXv2_data

This is a repository for training files, required for classification with the CONSTAXv2 software.

### Datasets currently included:
- UNITE General Release Fungi Feb 4 2020 - sh_general_release_fungi_35077_RepS_04.02.2020

### Files included for each include only RDP associated files. RDP training is memory intensive, and thus cannot be performed locally for many users.
